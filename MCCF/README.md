# MCCF Package

The `MCCF` package collects utilities used by the Mekong Centre for Climate Finance. It contains two main groups of code:

1. **PDP8 mapping tools (`MCCF/PDP8`)** – scripts for producing interactive maps of Vietnam's power projects and grid infrastructure.
2. **API & translation helpers (`MCCF/API tools`)** – standalone scripts that integrate with Google Cloud and OpenAI for OCR and translation tasks.

Most modules are intended to be executed directly rather than imported. See the repository [README](../README.md) for installation and usage instructions.
